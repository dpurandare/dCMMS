# dCMMS Authentication & Authorization Specifications

## User Seeding (Production & Dev/Test)

- In production deployments, if no users exist, the system will automatically seed a single admin user with a known, strong default password. On first login, the admin will be shown a mandatory reminder to change their password immediately. This reminder is not shown in dev/test environments.
- In dev/test, standard users (admin, manager, technician) are seeded with known credentials for testing and sample data is provided.

**Version:** 2.0 (Updated with Industry Research)
**Date:** November 8, 2025
**Status:** Draft - For Review
**Priority:** P0 (Critical for MVP)

        "value": "{{user.siteIds}}"
      },
      {
        "attribute": "user.role",
        "operator": "notEquals",
        "value": "system-admin"
      }
    ]
  },
  "description": "Users can only access resources in their assigned sites (except admins)"
}
```

#### Policy 2: Technician Self-Assignment Only
```json
{
  "policyId": "tech-assigned-only",
  "effect": "allow",
  "action": "execute:work-orders",
  "condition": {
    "or": [
      {
        "attribute": "resource.assignedTo",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "{{user.userId}}"
      },
      {

        "operator": "in",
        "value": ["maintenance-supervisor", "site-manager", "system-admin"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Policy 3: Business Hours Restriction for Contractors
```json
{
  "policyId": "contractor-business-hours",
  "effect": "deny",
  "condition": {
    "and": [
      {
        "attribute": "user.employmentType",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "contractor"
      },
      {
        "attribute": "env.time.hour",
        "operator": "notBetween",
        "value": [8, 17]
      }
    ]
  },

        "description": "Must be within 5km of asset to execute work on mobile"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3.3 ABAC Policy Evaluation

**Algorithm:**
1. Collect all applicable policies for (user, action, resource)
2. Evaluate each policy's conditions
3. If any policy has `effect: deny` and condition is TRUE → DENY (explicit deny wins)
4. If any policy has `effect: allow` and condition is TRUE → ALLOW
5. Default → DENY (whitelist approach)

---

## 4. Token Management

### 4.1 Access Token (JWT)

**Lifetime:** 15 minutes
**Refresh Strategy:** Use refresh token to obtain new access token
**Storage:** Memory only (never localStorage for web, secure keychain for mobile)

**Claims:**
```json
{
  "sub": "user-123",
  "email": "john.smith@example.com",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "role": "field-technician",
  "siteIds": ["SITE-ALPHA-001"],
  "skills": ["electrical-hv", "inverter-repair"],
  "employmentType": "employee",
  "permissions": ["read:work-orders:assigned", "execute:work-orders:assigned"],
  "iat": 1730563000,
  "exp": 1730563900,
  "iss": "https://auth.dcmms.io",
  "aud": "dcmms-api"
}
```

### 4.2 Refresh Token

**Lifetime:** 7 days (rolling)
**Storage:** Secure, HttpOnly cookie (web), encrypted keychain (mobile)
**Rotation:** New refresh token issued with each refresh

**Security:**
- Opaque token (not JWT)
- Stored hashed in database
- Single use (invalidated on refresh)
- Revocable
- Family tracking (detect token theft)

**Refresh Flow:**
```
1. Client sends refresh token to /auth/refresh
2. Server validates refresh token
3. Server invalidates old refresh token
4. Server issues new access token + new refresh token
5. Client stores new refresh token, uses new access token
```

**Token Theft Detection:**
- If old (invalidated) refresh token is reused → Revoke entire token family (all tokens for that session)
- Notify user of suspicious activity

### 4.3 API Key (Service Accounts)

**Use Case:** Service-to-service authentication (e.g., SCADA collector → API)

**Lifetime:** No expiry, but must be rotated every 90 days (policy)

**Format:** `dcmms_<environment>_<random-32-chars>`

**Storage:** Encrypted in vault (Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

**Permissions:** Specific permissions per API key (least privilege)

**Rotation Procedure:**
1. Generate new API key
2. Update service configuration with new key
3. Validate new key works
4. Revoke old key after grace period (e.g., 48 hours)

### 4.4 Token Revocation

**Reasons for Revocation:**
- User logout
- Password change
- User deactivation
- Security incident
- Token theft detection

**Revocation Methods:**
1. **Refresh Token Revocation** - Invalidate refresh token in database
2. **Access Token Revocation** - Add to revocation list (with expiry) checked on each request
3. **User Session Revocation** - Revoke all tokens for a user

**Revocation Endpoint:**
```http
POST /api/v1/auth/revoke
{
  "token": "refresh-token-or-access-token",
  "revokeAll": false  // true to revoke all user sessions
}
```

---

## 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### 5.1 MFA Requirements

**Required For:**
- System Administrator role
- Emergency Responder role
- Any user with `approve:work-orders` permission
- Contractor accounts
- Access from untrusted networks

**Optional For:**
- Field Technician (recommended)
- Inventory Manager

### 5.2 MFA Methods

**Primary: Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)**
- Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)
- 6-digit code, 30-second validity
- QR code enrollment

**Secondary: SMS (less secure, fallback only)**
- Send code to registered phone number
- 6-digit code, 10-minute validity
- Rate limited (max 3 per hour)

**Tertiary: Hardware Token (optional, for high-security)**
- FIDO2 / WebAuthn
- YubiKey, etc.

### 5.3 MFA Enrollment Flow

1. User enables MFA in profile settings
2. System generates TOTP secret
3. Display QR code to user
4. User scans with authenticator app
5. User enters verification code
6. System validates and saves secret (encrypted)
7. System generates backup codes (10 single-use codes)
8. User saves backup codes securely

### 5.4 MFA Verification Flow

**Login:**
1. User provides username + password → Verify
2. If MFA enabled → Prompt for MFA code
3. User provides TOTP code
4. System verifies code (allow ±1 time window for clock skew)
5. If valid → Issue access + refresh tokens

**High-Risk Actions:**
- Certain actions (e.g., user deletion, global settings change) require MFA re-verification even if already logged in
- "Step-up authentication" - prompt for MFA code before executing action

### 5.5 MFA Recovery

**Backup Codes:**
- 10 single-use codes generated at enrollment
- Each code can be used once instead of TOTP
- User should store securely (print, password manager)

**Account Recovery (if backup codes lost):**
- Contact administrator
- Admin verifies identity (out-of-band)
- Admin resets MFA for user
- User re-enrolls

---

## 6. Service Account Management

### 6.1 Service Account Types

**API Key Accounts:**
- SCADA collectors
- Edge devices
- Integration services (ERP, weather API consumers)

**OAuth Client Credentials:**
- Internal microservices
- Batch jobs
- Scheduled reports

### 6.2 Service Account Creation

**Process:**
1. Request via ticketing system (with justification)
2. Security team approval
3. Create service account with minimal permissions
4. Generate credentials (API key or client secret)
5. Securely transfer credentials (vault, secure email)
6. Document in service account registry

**Service Account Metadata:**
- Service name
- Owner/team
- Purpose
- Permissions granted
- Creation date
- Last rotation date
- Expiry date (if applicable)

### 6.3 Service Account Monitoring

**Audit Requirements:**
- Log all API calls with service account ID
- Monitor usage patterns (baseline expected usage)
- Alert on anomalies (unexpected endpoints, high volume, off-hours)
- Quarterly access review

---
