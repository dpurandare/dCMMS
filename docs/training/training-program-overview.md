on Inverter INV-045. Let's click to investigate...

[Screen: Anomaly detail page]
We see:
- Confidence: 94% - Our model is highly confident this is a real issue
- Anomaly Score: 0.87 - Anything above 0.75 is flagged
- Root Cause: DC voltage irregularities suggest MPPT controller issue
- Recommendation: Inspect within 24-48 hours

[Show time-series chart]
This chart shows normal voltage in green, and you can see the
irregularities starting around 9:45 AM. This is not something
a human would typically catch until it caused a failure.

### Sample FAQs (ML & Predictive Maintenance)

**Q1: What is anomaly detection and how does it work?**
A: Anomaly detection uses machine learning models to identify unusual patterns in equipment telemetry data. Our models are trained on historical "normal" behavior and flag deviations that could indicate impending failures. For example, if an inverter's DC voltage starts oscillating irregularly, the model detects this as an anomaly even before it causes a fault.

**Q2: How accurate is the anomaly detection?**
A: Our anomaly detection models achieve 92-96% accuracy with less than 5% false positive rate. Accuracy improves over time as the model learns from your specific equipment. We recommend a 3-month training period for optimal results.

**Q3: What does the "confidence" percentage mean?**
A: Confidence indicates how certain the model is that detected pattern is truly anomalous. 94% confidence means the model is highly certain this is a real issue, not normal variation. We typically flag anomalies with confidence >80%.

**Q4: What is RUL (Remaining Useful Life)?**
A: RUL is an estimate of how many days an asset can continue operating before it's likely to fail or require maintenance. For example, "RUL: 42 days (±7 days)" means the asset will likely need maintenance in 35-49 days based on current degradation trends.

**Q5: Should I create a work order for every anomaly?**
A: Not necessarily. Use the severity and confidence level to prioritize:
- **HIGH severity + >90% confidence:** Create work order immediately
- **MEDIUM severity + >85% confidence:** Schedule within 1 week
- **LOW severity or <80% confidence:** Monitor and investigate if pattern persists

**Q6: Can I adjust anomaly detection sensitivity?**
A: Yes! Admin users can adjust the anomaly score threshold in Settings → ML Models → Anomaly Detection. Default threshold is 0.75. Lowering it detects more anomalies (more false positives), raising it reduces alerts (might miss real issues).

**Q7: How often are ML predictions updated?**
A: Anomaly detection runs continuously (every 5 minutes). Predictive maintenance scores and RUL estimates update hourly. Energy forecasts regenerate every 6 hours.

**Q8: What data is used for energy forecasting?**
A: Energy forecasting combines:
- Historical generation data (last 2 years)
- Weather forecasts (irradiance, temperature, cloud cover)
- Equipment health status (healthy equipment generates more efficiently)
- Seasonal patterns and trends

**Q9: Can I retrain ML models with my own data?**
A: Yes! Enterprise customers can work with our ML team to retrain models on site-specific data. This improves accuracy for equipment brands, local weather patterns, and operational characteristics unique to your site. Contact support@dcmms.com.

**Q10: What if the ML prediction is wrong?**
A: ML predictions are probabilistic, not certainties. If a prediction was incorrect (false alarm or missed issue), please report it via Feedback button. This data helps us continuously improve our models. You can also override predictions manually if you have domain expertise.
