## Task Number Gaps (Descoped/Deferred Tasks)

The following task numbers were planned but not implemented. These tasks were either:
1. Descoped per stakeholder decisions (see STAKEHOLDER_DECISIONS.md)
2. Deferred to future releases
3. Merged into other tasks during implementation

**Sprint 1-4 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-018 through DCMMS-027 (10 tasks)
- DCMMS-038 through DCMMS-041 (4 tasks)
- DCMMS-045 (1 task)
- DCMMS-048 (1 task)

**Sprint 9-10 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-079 (1 task)

**Sprint 10-11 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-084 through DCMMS-087 (4 tasks)

**Sprint 11-12 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-091 through DCMMS-094 (4 tasks)

**Sprint 12-13 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-101 (1 task)

**Sprint 14-15 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-112 through DCMMS-115 (4 tasks)

**Sprint 15-16 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-120 through DCMMS-122 (3 tasks)

**Sprint 16-17 Gaps:**
- DCMMS-128 through DCMMS-135 (8 tasks)

**Total Descoped:** 40 tasks (~40% of original plan)

**Reason:** Agile development with stakeholder-driven prioritization led to scope adjustments. These gaps represent normal sprint planning evolution.
